# Poetry Generation with Transformer (GPT-2)
which demonstrates poetry generation using the GPT-2 model, a powerful transformer-based language model

# Environment Setup:
Install the required libraries, including the transformers library.

# Mount Google Drive:
If using data from Google Drive, mount it to access files and datasets.

# Load Transformer Model and Tokenizer:
Load the GPT-2 model and tokenizer from the transformers library.

# Load Poetry Dataset:
Load a dataset of poems, assuming they are stored in text files.

# Preprocess and Flatten the Dataset:
Preprocess the dataset by flattening the nested structure of ballads.

# Tokenization and DataLoader Setup:
Tokenize the poems using the GPT-2 tokenizer and set up a DataLoader.

# Model Training:
Define batch size and sequence length.

Train the GPT-2 model using the fastai library.

# Generate Poetry:
Provide a prompt for the model to generate poetry.
